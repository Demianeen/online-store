# Clothing online store

This is my pet-project. I entirely made this project myself. I had some knowledge at the beginning of the project, and I acquired others while creating the project.
This clothing store has almost all it takes to be called a store. It has a home page, shop page, cart page, and sign-in/up pages. It also has a back-end part. All necessary data fetch from there.

## The Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project was to gain more experience in writing real websites as a part of my education and to show my knowledge. Also, I am looking for my first job.

## Technologies

This is a full-stack project that was written using the PERN stack.

For routing, I use React-routing-dom. As a state manager, I used Redux with Redux toolkit. For data fetching and caching, I used RTK Query. And as ORM, I used Sequelize.

Project's site: <http://mybrandview.co.uk/>

## What did I learn

While creating this website, I learned many new things besides getting better at technologies I already knew.

I got better at data fetching. I learn how to:

- track loading state
- cache data and managing it
- make optimistic updates
- avoid duplicate requests for the same data

Also, I now know routing in react much better. I am relatively new at routing, but now I have a better understanding of using different hooks (`useNavigate`, `useHistory`, `useParams`).

Also, I learned how to write custom selectors in redux and generate selectors with `createEntitySelector` for better optimization.

I also learned how to use Sequelize and Express better. Despite being relatively new to the backend, I now know how to connect and interact with the database much better. In addition, I learned how to migrate data using Sequelize-CLI.
